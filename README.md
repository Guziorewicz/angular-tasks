The Task Manager App allows users to manage tasks efficiently by providing a clean and intuitive interface built with Angular. The app is styled using Bootstrap for responsive design and modern aesthetics.

## Key Features:

### Task List Display:
The app displays a list of tasks with their respective details: task title, description, and status.  
Tasks are displayed in a card-based layout, with each card showing the task information and controls for changing the status.

### Add New Task:
A static form positioned at the top of the page enables users to add new tasks. The form remains fixed in place even when the user scrolls the page, ensuring easy access.

The form includes fields for entering the task's title, description, and selecting its initial status from a dropdown (with options: OPEN, IN_PROGRESS, DONE).  
Bootstrap form validation ensures users enter valid data before submitting.
